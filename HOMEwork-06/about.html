    <h2>
        Artist Identity
    </h2>
</center>

<blockquote>
    Art has been with me ever since I was a child. I did my very first piece in fourth grade, which was a watercolored painting of a robin. I remember finishing it and being stunned by how it actually looked good. I loved the feeling of pride and joy when I looked at that bird, which still hangs in my mom's house today. Ever since then I continued to create, and now I find myself at UMT studying all differant kinds of art, art history, media arts, paintings, drawings, ceramics, charcoal work, etc. Below, I will list my most recent works.

    <h3> Character Design for Magna Ruina</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
        Magna ruina is my 'in the works' video game idea. It will hopefully develop into a cute dating sim with all of my characters, revoling around a tense plotline. I adore my characters and I really hope this dream of mine, to have my own game produced, comes true.
    </li>
   </ul>

    <h3>
        Comfort Art/ Silly Art 
    </h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        In fine arts, people in the program know me for painting the most weird and rediculous things. I like drawing and painting animals and other things that can just be naturally funny to look at. Here are some examples of what I mean.
    </li>

<h3>
    Media-Inspired Art
</h3>

<ul> 
    <li>
        I feel we are all effected by the media in one way or another, but I know for sure it affects my art, as well as my inspiration to create more. These artworks below are inspired by several differant sources, genshin impact, overwatch, and MLB.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Personal Identity
</h2>
<img src="images/nb flag.PNG" width="500" alt="nonbinary flag">
<blockquote>
    I have identified as nonbinary for around 4 years now. My pronouns are they/them/theirs, and I prefer gender nutreal terms and compliments. It took me a while to come to terms witht this part of my identity. Gender was something I never looked into, not until highschool. Growing up, I truly believed everyone felt uncomfortable being put in a binary; "boy" and "girl" both felt equally uncomfortable and wrong for me. But because I never knew there was a way to exsist outside of that binary, I coped, and just decided to be uncomfortable. It was all I knew. I am extremely lucky and grateful to have such a supporting, educating, and inclusive enviroment now, and when I was just beginning to dip my toes into this new chapter in my life. I changed my old name to Canyon, based on this cool adventure time character.

    <blockquote>
    I surrounded myself with other nonbinary people and felt seen. I learned more and more about gender, sexuality, my sexuality, and even have had opportunites to spread that knowledge to other people who needed it. I began taking hormone therapy 50 weeks ago today, and have noticed signifigant changes in my voice that makes me feel extremly euphoric. I'm also getting gender-affirming top surgery March 15th, and could not be happier about it. I am extremley happy with my transition and my new gender identity. Experiencing my true self in college has had its ups and downs, but I am such a happier, more true version of myself now.
