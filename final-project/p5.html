This program was really intimadating at first, and unlike most things, it only got more and more intimidating! Learning how to use it by making drawins was fun and helpful, but as we advanced to greater tools this prgram could do, the more things could go wrong. I felt really afraid of this programming for a while, but the longer I used it, the less afraid I became. But that didnt stop the massive amount of bugs I always had with it. I think these bugs helped me to learn about creative problem solving though, and ultimatley made me a better coder. It's really fun to see the advancement of my work in this site, from my drawing at the start, to my silly game at the end!

This project was all about drawing with code, specifically with a program called P5.Js. This is the program I used until the last weeks of class! I did a self portrait for project 8, which looked like this! <a href="https://canyonhardy.github.io/MART-120/homework-09/sketch.html" style="color:rgb(97, 67, 97)">The live site to see this portrait drawn</a> is also still avaliable to view. It came out actually looking okay, sort of similary to how I actually draw myself! Examples below:

<p>
    For project 9, we were supposed to get things animated. I wasnt sure how to do this neatly, because unlike everyone else's portraits, I didnt use simple shapes. I used lots of lines, so it was a bit extra challenging to get the things moving. Once I figured out how to move the glasses, I was all set to move the eyes and mouth. To see the actual animation of this project, <a href="https://canyonhardy.github.io/MART-120/homework-10/sketch.html" style="color:rgb(29, 29, 54)">the webisite is still animating it now!</a>

<p> For the first draft of the game I designed, I made a simple game where there are enemy objects falling from the sky repeatedly. You play as a little pink circle guy, and the goal is to go through the exsit.

<p> This project was identical to the first draft on the surface, but in the code, lots has been tidied up.

</p> I added borders and colored everything differantly! I also added a bit of styling to the HTML site everything was on. I didn't have the patience to learn how to add collision physics to the game, but if I did, I would have added them to the borders, the maze, the floating orange blobs, and the angry cubes. Overall, I am pretty happy with the final version, and I hope you check it out!
