        Coding Projects from this Semester
    </h2>
    <div class="intro">
<p>
    At the beginning of this semester, I was not at ALL confident to code anything. I was so SO worried that I would struggle to remember what means what, worried I would be unable to problem solve, unable to focus. But as we went along I realized how incredibly fun, easy, and impactful coding is. Learning this art form has made me interested in an ENTIRE new field, and given me inspiration to create. I have felt inspired to make my own atome game because of this class, and it's also made me feel like its a real possibility for me to make something like that. Needless to say, I feel like I have come super far. Now, let's look at some of that progress together!

<p>
This week, we learned the very basics with a program called Code.org. I learned how to drag and drop bits of code onto eachother to see how they work visually. I used the program to draw a nonbinary flag for my homework.

    <p>
For this project, we were tasked with making an animation/game in scratch. I made a small, relaxing animation with a frog and a fly. This took a lot of time, but it taught me the basics of scratch, and I am really proud of it! <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/797775424/"style="color:lavenderblush">The animation is still active and can be viewed here.</a>

    <img src="images/hw 3 b.PNG" width="250" alt="tennis game">
    <p>
        This week, I used Code.org to make 2 interactive games. The first one was a ghost game, where the goal is to scare the tennis players to earn points. <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/playlab/VNoHdcZGwUlk0Xuloio88invFNv_8_8_0w04WYX4PrA" style="color:lemonchiffon">Its still avaliable to play here!</a> The second game is probably my favorite thing that I have coded. I designed a frog interaction app, and its really really silly. I really love this dumb little game, even though its super simple. <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/SswXaxZ3UOSLb756Bh-j0MJxikNRUIsIZheCIsZ7Eb0"style="color:lemonchiffon">It is also still avalible to play, thankfully!</a>

<p>
    This week, we learned how to use the 'alice' program. It was really hard for me to get a few things to work, and at one point, I thought I accidently deleted all of my progress. Luckily there was a backupfile in the deep recesses of my computer folders. I made a silly project, where you had to find the hidden iguanas around the map that insult the player character (which is an alligator). It was pretty silly but I enjoyed it enough.

        Welcome to my first websites! As you can tell, I have definetly come a long long way with my webdesign- specifically with styling them. My <a href="https://canyonhardy.github.io/MART-120/HOMEwork-06/home.html" style="color:honeydew">Canyon's Favorites page</a> was a showcase of my knowlage at the time, which I really thought was impressive. Knowing what I do now, I am SURE I can make a site just like this way WAY better. Here's the <a href="https://canyonhardy.github.io/MART-120/HOMEwork-06/about.html"style="color:honeydew">Artist Page</a> and the <a href="https://canyonhardy.github.io/MART-120/HOMEwork-06/contact.html"style="color:honeydew">Contact Page</a> for those sites. Comparing the code from these old sites to the code im working on currently, its pretty simple!

    For project 6, <a href="https://canyonhardy.github.io/MART-120/homework-07/home.html" style="color:peachpuff">I updated my first website</a> with the new knowlage I had. Only small changes were made, like adding a bit of styling with fonts, <a href="https://canyonhardy.github.io/MART-120/homework-07/about.html" style="color:peachpuff">adding background images to the Artist Page</a>, and most importantly, adding an outside resource to style my <a href="" style="color:peachpuff">Contact Page.</a>

It now has feedback in case you dont fill out information! It was hard to code and doesnt work entirely right, but learning this curve helped me with learning how to make coding websites a bit more user friendly/interactable.</p>
