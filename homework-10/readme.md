Hi Michael, I wanted to talk about my project here before you check it out. If you even are seeing this to begin with! I wanted my portrait to be kinda animated, so, i made the y axis rotation on the eyes really really rapid.. there wasnt anything that said it HAD to hit the ends of the screen, nor about the pace.. but i hope this still is acceptable for making a simple shape move along this axis. I justy thought doing it like this would LOOK the best. AND, the mouth IS moving diagnol, its just.. so fast. you might not be able to tell. But it is! I think its cute, it looks like im talking because its so fast! These decisions might not 100% align with the grading rubricks reqirements but i wanted to take some artistic librities so my self portait atleast made some sense!!!
